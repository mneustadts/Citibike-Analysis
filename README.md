# Citibike-Analysis

## Summary
For this analysis I was tasked with taking in a random set of Citi Bike data from New York city and visualizing it usng the tool Tableau. This was an analysis of very large datasets in which the files were not uploadable to Github. I used a jupyter notebook on my local computer in order to clean the data and randomize it for easier accesability when I started using the tool Tableau. In the future I will certainly us a big data tool such as google Colabs in order to clean datasets such as the ones in this analysis so that it is easier to upload.
